## Test

In order to guarantee the stability of PageHelper, the project contains a large number of unit tests, and can be tested for supported databases.

### Multi database test

To make it easier to test different databases, 
add a different database mybatis configuration file to the `src/test/resources` directory, 
and modify the configuration in `test.properties` 
so that the tests can be tested with different configurations.

In order to make it easier to test different database, 
there are many different mybatis profile in the `src/test/resources` directory.
By modifying the `test.properties` allows you to test different databases.
